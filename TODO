TODO:

- DropDown: this should close list when pressed again. Now, the problem is
  that list closes itself by getting FocusLost, and then the label reopens
  it.

- Quickslot development: I want a quickslot bag, where each individual
  quickslot can be: (1) skinned alias (right click to change skin), (2)
  sequence slot, (3) quickslot menu (open more options), (4) regular
  quickslot.

- Quickslots: Aliases cant be dragged to built-in quickslots.

- Partly done: Write user instructions

- ZIP is 'MaKoPlugins-master', not 'MaKoPlugins'

- Investigate: When creating plugin options panel, SizeChanged()
  gets correct width (GetWidth), but height (GetHeight) is not changed at
  all.

DONE:

- DONE: Custom Window class: one that recognizes both ESC and F12
