TODO:

- Partly done: Write user instructions

- ZIP is 'MaKoPlugins-master', not 'MaKoPlugins'

- Investigate: When creating plugin options panel, SizeChanged()
  gets correct width (GetWidth), but height (GetHeight) is not changed at
  all.

- DropDown: this should close list when pressed again. Now, the problem is
  that list closes itself by getting FocusLost, and then the label reopens
  it.

DONE:

- DONE: Custom Window class: one that recognizes both ESC and F12
