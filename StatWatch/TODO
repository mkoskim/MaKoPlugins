TODO:

- Cap for Outgoing Healing: We probably don't implement this... Although
  outgoing healing and tactical mastery have different cap rating, it might
  be better to view outgoing heals as percentage.
  
  * Note: Partial BPE works the same. So it would be great to show the
    "rate" as percentage, but still have a cap.

- There are separate icons for Expand/Collapse all (++ and --). Find their
  IDs. Those icons should also contain non-focus / focus / pressed versions.

- 'Essence' values? Divide stat by corresponding greater essence rating, so
  that you could estimate how many essences you would need to reach the rating.

- No update (uninstall handlers) when minimized / group is collapsed

- Separate window for real time stat tracking?

- Different window setups?

- Icon for refresh button - and it could be 'hidden' somewhere...

- It would be good to have stats and differences in different formats,
  that is, for example, stats as percentages and differences in ratings.

- Take stats from chat and use them as reference. We should add player
  name (and class?) to chat message.

- What if we combine those two floating buttons in single window?

- Sharing: Show overcapping values, too, to see if e.g. mits for T2C
  are overcapped enough.

FIX:

- Beorn is entirely missing! Add armor type and ClassAsString entries.

POSTPONED / IGNORED:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- DONE: Share window: Would be nice if created shortcut would disappear after
  sharing, to prevent unnecessary spamming.

- DONE: Officier channel to channel selection list

- DONE: Expand/Collapse All

- Fixed: Power/Morale update works wrongly

- DONE: Setting reference values

- DONE: Setting cap ratings as reference (when they exist). Can be computed
  from segment info.

- DONE: Colors for differences

- DONE: Mastery is nowadays capped at 80k (200%). Mastery percentage
  calculation has no repeating block

- DONE: Dump stats to chat
  
- Fixed: Autoloading

- DONE: Small movable buttons (skinned shortcuts, or even buttons) for access,
  show/hide in options panel: Not all people have the same amount of quickslots
  on screen as I do.

- Fixed: Seems that stat fields are sometimes empty when opening window.
  It happens on my champ. Check & fix.

- DONE: ToggleButton handles ESC which hides it when pressing ESC to close
  windows. ToggleButtons should stay visible. Fix this.
