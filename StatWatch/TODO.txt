DONE:

- Fixed: Power/Morale update works wrongly

- DONE: Setting reference values

- DONE: Setting cap ratings as reference (when they exist). Can be computed
  from segment info.

- DONE: Colors for differences

- DONE: Mastery is nowadays capped at 80k (200%). Mastery percentage
  calculation has no repeating block

MISC:

- 'Essence' values? Divide stat by corresponding greater essence rating, so
  that you could estimate how many essences you would need to reach the rating.

- Dump stats to chat
  
- No update when minimized / group is collapsed

- Separate window for real time stat tracking

- Different window setups?

- Icon for refresh button - and it could be 'hidden' somewhere...

- It would be good to have stats and differences in different formats,
  that is, for example, stats as percentages and differences in ratings.
