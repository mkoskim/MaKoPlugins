DONE:

TODO:

- Misc.lua: Currently, we "inject" fields and functions to global plugin object:
  need to ensure if this is safe.
  
- Misc.lua: When unloading the plugin, we temporarily inject global plugin
  variable again. Need to ensure if this is safe.

- Misc.lua: Some kind of command line helper...
